## Installation

1. I started the project by pseudo coding. This way I created a strategy on how to tackle on building the quiz and then writing the code. 

2. First I created the HTML. It includes the Start Quiz button. The questions that will be listed, answer choices, a counter, time gauge and a score.

3. Second, I created the css where I centered the Start Quiz button. The question image which is on the upper left corner. Center question container to display the question in the middle of the quiz box and answer choices below.

4. Next I worked on the Javascript. I started by listing all the ids and delcaring all my elements.

5. Moving on, I created all my questions, listed the answer choices, correct answer and image source. 

6. I created a click event listener for the quiz to start, then a function which prompts the questions to be displayed and timer ot start.

7. I created a function to run the questions, which means it diplays the questions each time the time runs out or a previous question is answered.

8. This next function actually displays the questions and the answer choices.

9. Next function displays a bar that turns green as the timer counts, it is the question progress bar.
